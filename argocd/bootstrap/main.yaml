# Bootstrap Application (App of Apps)
# This application watches argocd/applications/ folder and automatically creates
# an ArgoCD Application for every YAML file found in that directory
#
# How it works:
# 1. Watches argocd/applications/ in your Git repository
# 2. For each YAML file, creates an ArgoCD Application resource
# 3. Those applications then sync their own content from Git
#
# Applied by Terraform during cluster bootstrap
